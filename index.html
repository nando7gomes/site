            My name is Fernando Gomes and I've been working as a designer for the past 15 years. I have a passion for technology and I'm constantly striving to keep myself up to date with the latest advancements in the field.

Over the years, I've gained extensive experience in various aspects of design, from graphic design to user interface design. I enjoy the challenge of taking complex information and presenting it in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

My love for technology extends beyond my professional life. I enjoy tinkering with gadgets and exploring new software and apps. I believe that technology has the power to transform the way we live and work, and I'm excited to be a part of this ever-evolving landscape.

When I'm not working or experimenting with technology, you can find me spending time with my family or pursuing my other interests, such as photography and hiking.
